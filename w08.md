# Top 10 List of Week 08

1. [scp](https://success.tanaza.com/s/article/How-to-use-SCP-command-on-Windows)<br>
he SCP is a network protocol which supports file transfers between hosts on a network. 

2. [Scheduling ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheduling_(production_processes))<br>
Scheduling is the process of arranging, controlling and optimizing work and workloads in a production process or manufacturing process. Scheduling is used to allocate plant and machinery resources, plan human resources, plan production processes and purchase materials.


3. [CPU Scheduling Algorithms in Operating Systems](https://www.guru99.com/cpu-scheduling-algorithms.html<br>
CPU Scheduling is a process of determining which process will own CPU for execution while another process is on hold. The main task of CPU scheduling is to make sure that whenever the CPU remains idle, the OS at least select one of the processes available in the ready queue for execution. The selection process will be carried out by the CPU scheduler. It selects one of the processes in memory that are ready for execution.

4. [Asymmetric multiprocessing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymmetric_multiprocessing)<br>
An asymmetric multiprocessing (AMP or ASMP) system is a multiprocessor computer system where not all of the multiple interconnected central processing units (CPUs) are treated equally. For example, a system might allow (either at the hardware or operating system level) only one CPU to execute operating system code or might allow only one CPU to perform I/O operations. Other AMP systems might allow any CPU to execute operating system code and perform I/O operations, so that they were symmetric with regard to processor roles, but attached some or all peripherals to particular CPUs, so that they were asymmetric with respect to the peripheral attachment.

5. [Symmetric multiprocessing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetric_multiprocessing)<br>
Symmetric multiprocessing (SMP) involves a multiprocessor computer hardware and software architecture where two or more identical processors are connected to a single, shared main memory, have full access to all input and output devices, and are controlled by a single operating system instance that treats all processors equally, reserving none for special purposes. Most multiprocessor systems today use an SMP architecture. In the case of multi-core processors, the SMP architecture applies to the cores, treating them as separate processors.

6. [NUMA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-uniform_memory_access)<br
Non-Uniform Memory Access (NUMA) is a computer memory design used in multiprocessing, where the memory access time depends on the memory location relative to the processor. Under NUMA, a processor can access its own local memory faster than non-local memory (memory local to another processor or memory shared between processors). The benefits of NUMA are limited to particular workloads, notably on servers where the data is often associated strongly with certain tasks or users.[1]task easier when you want to write and read blocks of data.

7. [Load balancing]https://www.citrix.com/en-id/glossary/load-balancing.html)<br>
Load balancing is defined as the methodical and efficient distribution of network or application traffic across multiple servers in a server farm. Each load balancer sits between client devices and backend servers, receiving and then distributing incoming requests to any available server capable of fulfilling them.

8. [A real-time scheduling]ttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheduling_analysis_real-time_systems<br>
A real-time scheduling System is composed of the scheduler, clock and the processing hardware elements. In a real-time system, a process or task has schedulability; tasks are accepted by a real-time system and completed as specified by the task deadline depending on the characteristic of the scheduling algorithm.

9. [big O notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_O_notation)<br>
In computer science, big O notation is used to classify algorithms according to how their run time or space requirements grow as the input size grows.[3] In analytic number theory, big O notation is often used to express a bound on the difference between an arithmetical function and a better understood approximation; a famous example of such a difference is the remainder term in the prime number theorem.

10. [linuxfromscratch](http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/)<br>
Linux From Scratch (LFS) is a project that provides you with step-by-step instructions for building your own custom Linux system, entirely from source code.
