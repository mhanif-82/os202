# Top 10 List of Week 04

1. [Mapping Virtual Addresses to Physical Addresses](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/mapping-virtual-addresses-to-physical-addresses/)<br>
I was searching for Address Binding. In short Address binding is the process of mapping from one address space to another address space. 
Logical address is address generated by CPU during execution whereas Physical Address refers to location in memory unit(the one that is loaded into memory)

2. [Memory Allocation](https://www.cs.uah.edu/~rcoleman/Common/C_Reference/MemoryAlloc.html/)<br>
This web site explain about memory allocations. In short Memory allocation is the process of setting aside sections of memory in a program to be used to store variables, 
and instances of structures and classes. 

3. [Virtual adress space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_address_space)<br>
I know it not that creative giving a wiki site, but i think it's the most useful one and i didnt found other web about virtual address that explain fairly easy.

4. [Physical address](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/13036/physical-address)<br>
In computing, a physical address, is a memory address that is represented in the form of a binary number on the address bus circuitry in order to enable the data bus 
to access a particular storage cell of main memory, or a register of memory mapped I/O device

5. [Main Memory](https://www.cs.uic.edu/~jbell/CourseNotes/OperatingSystems/8_MainMemory.html)<br>
I found better web site that explain everyng about main memory and so on. I think this is way more detailed and explain more related about memory.

6. [Fragmantation](https://www.webopedia.com/TERM/F/fragmentation.html)<br>
Fragmentation is a phenomenon in which storage space is used inefficiently, reducing capacity or performance and often both. 
The exact consequences of fragmentation depend on the specific system of storage allocation in use and the particular form of fragmentation.

7. [Hardware Protection](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/hardware-protection-and-type-of-hardware-protection/)<br>
We know that a computer system contains the hardware like processor, monitor, RAM and many more, and one thing that the operating system ensures that these devices can not directly accessible by the user.
Basically, hardware protection is divided into 3 categories: CPU protection, Memory Protection, and I/O protection.

8. [Pointers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pointer_(computer_programming))<br>
Pointer is an object in many programming languages that stores a memory address. This can be that of another value located in computer memory, or in some cases, that of memory-mapped computer hardware.

9. [Pointer in c](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cprogramming/c_pointers.htm)<br>
A pointer is a variable whose value is the address of another variable, i.e., direct address of the memory location. Now we learn how to use pointer in c.

10. [Struct](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Struct_(C_programming_language))<br>
A struct in the C programming language (and many derivatives) is a composite data type (or record) declaration that defines a physically grouped list of variables under one name in a block of memory, allowing the different variables to be accessed via a single pointer or by the struct declared name which returns the same address. 
The struct data type can contain other data types so is used for mixed-data-type records such as a hard-drive directory entry (file length, name, extension, physical address, etc.), or other mixed-type records (name, address, telephone, balance, etc.).
