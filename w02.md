# Top 10 List of Week 02

1. [Learning C](https://www.programiz.com/c-programming#flow-control)<br>
I found very simple and clean website to teach how to learn c. Why i choose this website? because i think this one have flow so we can learn fro the basic or just skip what topic we want to learn. 

2. [Cryptography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptography)<br>
Cryptography is the science of protecting information by transforming it into a secure format. This process, called encryption, has been used for centuries to prevent handwritten messages from being read by unintended recipients. Today, cryptography is used to protect digital data

3. [Symmetric cryptography and asymmetric cryptography](https://www.ssl2buy.com/wiki/symmetric-vs-asymmetric-encryption-what-are-differences)<br>
The main point symmetric encryption uses a single key that needs to be shared among the people who need to receive the message while asymmetrical encryption uses a pair of public key and a private key to encrypt and decrypt messages when communicating

4. [Privacy](https://iapp.org/about/what-is-privacy/)<br>
Privacy is the ability of an individual or group to seclude themselves or information about themselves, and thereby express themselves selectively. When something is private to a person, it usually means that something is inherently special or sensitive to them. Now in todays age almost every startup have our data and they can use it for martketing. It's really hard to keep privacy, we usullay trade it for services. 

5. [Authentication](https://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/definition/authentication)<br>
Authentication is the act of proving an assertion, such as the identity of a computer system user. In contrast with identification, the act of indicating a person or thing's identity, authentication is the process of verifying that identity

6.[Password vs biometrics](https://password-managers.bestreviews.net/biometrics-vs-passwords-biometrics-secure/)<br>
Password is easly to remmeber if you only have a few of it. the average U.S. consumer has 130 accounts associated with one email address. That’s a lot of passwords to remember. That’s why many people use the same credentials across multiple accounts. Which means if a hacker steals the username and password for one account, he or she will have a better chance of hacking other services.

7. [Acces control matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Access_Control_Matrix)<br>
An Access Control Matrix is a table that maps the permissions of a set of subjects to act upon a set of objects within a system. The matrix is a two-dimensional table with subjects down the columns and objects across the rows. The permissions of the subject to act upon a particular object are found in the cell that maps the subject to that object.

8. [DDOS](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/what-is-a-ddos-attack/)<br>
In computing, a denial-of-service attack is a cyber-attack in which the perpetrator seeks to make a machine or network resource unavailable to its intended users by temporarily or indefinitely disrupting services of a host connected to the Internet

9. [Backdoor](https://www.malwarebytes.com/backdoor/)<br>
A backdoor is a typically covert method of bypassing normal authentication or encryption in a computer, product, embedded device, or its embodiment. Backdoors are most often used for securing remote access to a computer, or obtaining access to plaintext in cryptographic systems

10. [Computer virus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_virus)<br>
A computer virus, much like a flu virus, is designed to spread from host to host and has the ability to replicate itself. Similarly, in the same way that flu viruses cannot reproduce without a host cell, computer viruses cannot reproduce and spread without programming such as a file or document.
